/**
 * The flush before an install went around every guarantee the store has.
 *
 * `hub:install-update` writes the renderer's final snapshot and then calls
 * quitAndInstall. It did that by hand:
 *
 *     const tmp = fp + '.tmp';
 *     await fs.promises.writeFile(tmp, serialized, 'utf8');
 *     await fs.promises.rename(tmp, fp);
 *
 * Four things wrong with it, all at the one moment the binary is about to be
 * replaced and the app cannot try again:
 *
 *   NO FSYNC            writeFile+rename leaves the bytes in the page cache, so
 *                       a power loss during the install can leave an empty or
 *                       partial store. atomicWriteStore fsyncs before swapping.
 *   NO .prev            the rename overwrote the primary without rotating it,
 *                       leaving the rollback copy describing a store two saves
 *                       old — which crash recovery then reads.
 *   BARE fp.tmp         the one filename recoverStoreRaw scans as a legacy
 *                       recovery candidate, so an interrupted flush left a file
 *                       the next launch would consider restoring from.
 *   OUTSIDE THE CHAIN   a renderer save already queued could land between this
 *                       rename and its own. The same race fixed for every LAN
 *                       endpoint in #898.
 *
 * The updater was only ever handed `encryptForDisk` and `dataFilePath`, so it
 * had no writer to call — which is how a second, weaker one came to exist.
