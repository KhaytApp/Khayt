/*
 * A printer that changed address is not a printer that went away.
 *
 * These tests are anchored on a real event rather than an imagined one. On
 * 2026-08-24 the bench Snapmaker U1 was mid-print and unreachable: its DHCP
 * lease had moved it from 192.168.68.77 to .56, Khayt was still polling .77, and
 * the shop's completion history was EMPTY rather than short — every job that had
 * finished in the meantime was a measurement that no longer existed, because
 * captureCompletion only ever fires on a live poll.
 *
 * mdns-u1-relocated.json is that printer's actual announcements, captured off
 * the LAN that afternoon. So the fixture is not a description of the bug; it is
 * the bug.
 *
 * The rule under test is narrow on purpose. Retargeting a machine is a WRITE, and
 * the thing being written is where the app will later send print commands. So a
 * serial match — identity the printer proved — may be applied, and everything
 * weaker may only ever be proposed.
